Project Overview:

This project implements Neural Style Transfer (NST), which is a technique that takes two images—a content image and a style image—and blends them together so that the output image looks like the content image, but painted in the style of the style image. This implementation uses a pre-trained VGG19 network to extract features from the images.

Installation Instructions:

To set up the environment and run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
3. Install the required libraries
4. Download the pre-trained VGG19 model weights

Usage:
1. Load the content and style images
2. Define the VGG model
3. Define loss functions
4. Run the neural style transfer

Dependencies
1. torch
2. torchvision
3. pillow
4. matplotlib

Make sure all dependencies are installed using the pip install command as shown in the installation instructions.
